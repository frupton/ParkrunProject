# ParkrunMap
A project to develop my skills using folium (displaying items on a map) to display parkruns and junior parkruns across the UK. It is also to get me used to using github properly for projects.
  
  Highlights which parkruns you have done
 
  Can hide the junior parkruns 
  
  Can show you which parkruns you haven't done that would add to your alphabet challenge score (run a parkrun starting with each letter of the alphabet)
